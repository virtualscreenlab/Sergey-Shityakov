# Virtual Screening Laboratory

## Overview
Virtual Screening Laboratory is a virtual laboratory designed for rational drug design and discovery, with a focus on the blood-brain barrier. This project, supervised by Prof. Dr. Sergey Shityakov from Würzburg University, Germany, includes a collection of tools and scripts to support cheminformatics, drug design, biomedicine, medicinal chemistry, and blood-brain barrier research.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sergey-Shityakov/virtualscreenlab.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
